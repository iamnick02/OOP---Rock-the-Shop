# ROCK_the_SHOP
## 📖 Description
"ROCK_the_SHOP" is a C++ project created as part of the Object-Oriented Programming course. The system is designed to manage an online store specializing in rock-themed products, such as clothing and musical discs. It showcases the use of advanced object-oriented principles to handle employee management, inventory control, and order processing efficiently.

## 🏆 Key Features
Employee Management:
- Includes roles such as managers, order operators, and assistants.
- Calculates salaries based on experience, bonuses, and performance.
Inventory Management:
- Adds, removes, and updates stock for products like clothing, CDs, and vintage records.
- Calculates delivery prices and handles product-specific attributes (e.g., color, brand, rarity).
Order Processing:
